### 3 Data Sources

* **Dataset 1: [optimal-chopsticks-length](https://devpost.com/software/optimal-chopsticks-length)**

* **Dataset 2: [Marriages in Taiwan of Different Nationalities](https://data.gov.tw/dataset/77135)**

* **Dataset 3: [Geographical Distances to the Other Countries](http://www.cepii.fr/pdf_pub/wp/2011/wp2011-25.pdf)**

The first weirdly interesting dataset is actually hits us Asian in a daily manner. The data originated in Taiwan came from experiments of the ways and positions people hold chopsticks of different lengths. Even more interestingly, a local saying is that the closer to the top of chopsticks a person holds, the further away the person will be married to, geographically. And so it connects to the second dataset documenting the actual marriages in Taiwan of different nationalities. In order to better visualize this, the third dataset provides the distances between countries/regions in values, which should support the visualization later.
