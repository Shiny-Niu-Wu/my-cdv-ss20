###Next

1. For now, the color change of the bar would be messed up if the user click too fast, resulting in a middle color between "target color" and black.
I hope to change this, so the color change does not affected by time, but by the next time the user clicks the buttons.

2. Fix the bugs for the bar-change function

3. Tidy up the code by combining the button functions
