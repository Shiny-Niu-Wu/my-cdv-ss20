### Map Exercise: Population Density

Using data sources from
1. [Taiwan Administrative Division geojson 2016] (https://sheethub.com/ronnywang/%E9%84%89%E9%8E%AE%E5%B8%82%E5%8D%80%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E5%8D%80%E5%9F%9F%E7%95%8C%E7%B7%9A)
Data then simplified using [mapshaper] (http://www.mapshaper.org/)
2. [Taiwan Administrative Division Population Density 2016](https://data.gov.tw/dataset/8410)
3. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/en.pop.dnst?end=2018&most_recent_year_desc=false&start=2018&view=map&year=2016

To figure out:
- Transition between different geoJson
- keep the zoomed area in a same, designated area/box
