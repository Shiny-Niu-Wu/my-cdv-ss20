### Responding to *Critical Questions for Big Data* by Danah Boyd and Kate Crawford

* **Prompt 1: Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both an oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)**

My internship at a global digital agency taught me that information is data processed, organized, and designed in a way one would like the receivers to view it. But data is never raw, considering the ways data is collected may have bias or other illegitimate procedures happening before the action of collecting. It is a bad idea if we take this kind of data as unquestionable facts while neglecting these potential questions of its “pureness” and “inclusiveness.” People have been imagining a future world fully-covered by technology where AI and robots do all the work, including making decisions for us. A short paragraph cannot fully express how this is both utopian and dystopian at the same time. The water that bears the boat is the same that swallows it up…… In short, just because data is widely used, doesn’t mean it is a definite future; just because data-driven is a future trend, doesn’t mean it is definite truth. I believe that we should constantly remind ourselves that behind an AI move or data result, there is always a human. As for the ethics of collecting personal economic data, that is another big topic.

* **Prompt 2: What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"?**

Industries and the general economic field follow the advancement of technology and undergo digital transformation, but technology follows humanity, and is always about how we interact with and adapt to the world. It is hard to conclude if it has been more difficult or easier to measure our interactions, the so-called “reality.” The consumer data collected online by these accounting tools may only represent some parts of one’s online behavior; the same applies to offline scenes like the customer record a convenience store staff manually enters in the cashier (most being replaced by app “membership”). Modern tools know more, or should we say, they know more of our “associated/related behaviors.” They shape the reality they measure, a “reality” which often makes the consumer status more valuable and beneficial, and in return helps the companies. However, once out of the scope, they may know nothing about their consumers, because after all, **these tools only measure parts of the “real life,” not to be concluded by the “reality” within the scope of a tool/specific economic behavior.** If only we did not live in a world that always shouts “tell me the numbers!”......

* **Prompt 3: In which way is Twitter data limited?**

The question is not “is Twitter data limited,” because we all know that the answer is positive. The real problem may be that many of us couldn't care less about how it is used, while lacking focus on other info resources. Facebook is another social media platform with related problems, including how we accept its privacy regulations without a blink, and how the platform knows your political leaning just by five random posts you liked. This data later decides what posts you see on your feed afterwards, and the worst case is it is blasting everywhere on the news in conclusion of you and other 2.4 billion “users’” opinions. Twitter and Facebook data is informative, considering humanity’s changing ways of communication and interactions. But whether or not being representative, the data collected will be labeled including the name Twitter/Facebook, and it would be a case by case matter vacillating on the spectrum. **Data is limited, in all the ways the text describes. However, when it comes to data’s potential for further problematic usages, that is when it becomes dangerous and unlimited.**

* **Prompt 4: If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.**

If there are no requirements of social status, gender, ethnicity/race, etc. to apply for an account, then logging in or not does not decide whether the platform is public and free. Dismissing the fact that “being public” and “being free” are already two large, different concepts, being “public and free” has to do with the platform’s exclusiveness. As it’s easier to gain online accesses and tools, the exclusivity rate decreases, making almost anything public and free, if one knows the way. It is different from a VIP invitation letter to an elite gathering at a private castle in the 15th century, where it is impossible for “outsiders” to know the inside conversations, and impossible for the “insiders” to share the content without live streaming/recording (say that they may be killed if they have big mouths). For online data that is already “left there and stored there,” it will not be private just because we want it to, not like a secret castle meeting. The truth is, everywhere you go leaves a trace. Even Clay Shirky says that the best way to keep your privacy is to not use those devices/services at all. But how could we, really?

* **Note**

While reading I recall this chart about public and private goods that I learned in high school.

Some say that the Internet is a public good. Moreover, there are many other concepts like net neutrality to consider when having the previous discussions.
