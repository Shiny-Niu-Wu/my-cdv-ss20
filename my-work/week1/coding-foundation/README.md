* I spent a lot of time reviewing vanilla Javascript since I often confuse myself when writing code with later knowledge of React and others.
* However, the exercise and self-learning solved a lot of logical questions I had before, in that knowing what exactly it means instead of just knowing how to type it out.
* Hopefully, I will add a "crazy mode" to the boxes later.
